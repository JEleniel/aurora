# Coding

## General Guidelines

- The language-specific rules in `../../instructions/*.instructions.md` take precedence over these instructions.
- Follow best practices for the language being edited. Language-specific configs (for example `rustfmt.toml`, `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `.prettierrc.json`) are authoritative.
- Keep code modular and cohesive (single responsibility). Prefer small functions (~20 lines) and small modules (~200 lines) when practical.
- Prefer small, cohesive changes. Fix root causes, not symptoms.
- Use the shortest acceptable path for local files.
- Prefer mature, well supported dependencies with GPL, MIT, or Apache-2.0 licenses.
    - Well-maintained heuristic (use judgment; not a checklist):
        - Active and responsive maintenance (issues/PRs triaged; CI is healthy).
        - Clear compatibility story (MSRV/edition/features) that matches the workspace.
        - Security posture is solid (no known unfixed advisories; timely fixes when issues occur).
        - Adoption is meaningful (downstream usage and/or strong community reputation).
        - Documentation quality is good (README, examples, and changelog/release notes).
        - Exception: clearly stable/feature-complete crates MAY be acceptable with explicit justification.
- Dependency management:
    - Prefer the latest stable crate versions, unless constrained by compatibility, MSRV, or security response.
    - Add dependencies at the narrowest practical scope (package-level, not workspace-wide) unless multiple crates truly share them.
    - Avoid new dependencies when the standard library or existing dependencies already solve the problem.

- Approved libraries
    - The following libraries are approved for use. Sublibraries include crates that share the parent prefix or are designed as companions. This is not an exhaustive list, just the most commonly used ones:
    - `anyhow`, `thiserror` for error handling
    - `axum` (and sublibraries), `tower` (and sublibraries), `hyper` (and sublibraries) for web servers
    - `base64`, `hex`, `num-traits`, `regex`, `unicode-normalization`, `uuid` for utilities
    - `chrono` for time and date handling
    - `clap` for CLI interfaces
    - `config` for configuration file handling
    - `ctrlc` for signal handling
    - `dirs` (preferred) or `directories` for standard config/data/cache directories
    - `fern` (preferred) or `tracing` (and sublibraries) for logging
    - `log` for logging API
    - `rig` for LLM access
    - `openssl` or `rustls` (and sublibraries) for TLS
    - `r2d2`, `r2d2_sqlite`, `rusqlite` for SQLite (use `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature)
    - `reqwest` for HTTP client calls
    - `serde` (and sublibraries), `serde_json` for serialization
    - `tokio` (and sublibraries) for async runtime
    - `url`, `urlencoding` for URL handling
    - `sha2`, and `hmac` for hashing

## Invariants

- For newly written or substantially rewritten code:
    - You MUST NOT allow any new source file to exceed 500 lines or 50MiB in size, whichever is smaller.
    - You MUST NOT write any new function that exceeds 50 lines in length.

- For pre-existing code that violates these size limits:
    - You SHOULD recommend refactoring when you encounter it.
    - You MUST NOT perform large refactors solely to satisfy the limits unless the task requires it.

- Unimplemented paths MUST fail fast and clearly communicate intent (`todo!`, `unimplemented!`, etc.).

## Errors and Logging

- Prefer typed errors within libraries/modules.
- Add context at application boundaries.
- Avoid unchecked failures (`unwrap`, `expect`, panics) unless justified by an explicit invariant.
- You MUST NOT disable checks/tests (for example `// @ts-nocheck`, `#[allow(...)]`). Fix the underlying issue instead.
- Include helpful TRACE and DEBUG logging where appropriate for troubleshooting.
- Log at boundaries with appropriate severity.
- Never log secrets at any level.

## Tests

For all added code:

- Add tests that prove behavior (positive and negative paths).
- Add tests that prove deterministic behavior, when appropriate (for example, fixed seeds for randomized tests).
- Add tests that prove secure behavior, e.g., malformed input, out of range values, etc.
- If tests need data files, or need to write files, create and use a `testdata` directory at the root of the source tree (e.g. `src/testdata/` for Rust code) and use that for test fixtures. Do not write files outside of the test environment.

## Deliverables

- Source code is modular, clean, readable, idiomatic, and aligned with project conventions.
- Appropriate unit and integration tests are added and passing.
    - Coverage target (aspirational): aim for 90%+ coverage on functional code when practical.
- Notes added for the documentation writer explaining changes, new features, and other relevant information for the project documentation.
- Linting, formatting, and static analysis checks are passing.
